# Calcium-Imaging-Analysis
Takes Image Stacks of Calcium Imaging and Associated ROIs and Computes dF/F and Baseline for all pixels, then produces an average Df/F and Baseline trace for each ROI. This activity trace is then smoothed and is plotted in a ridge-like plot to compare all ROIs visually. Finally, the correlation matrix between each ROI (that is between each motor area) is computed and subsequently clustered to infer motor pattern and area symmetry and synchrony.
